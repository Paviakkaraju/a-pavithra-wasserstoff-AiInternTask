# Domain Specific PDF summarization and Keyword Extraction Pipeline

* The objective is to build a pipeline that processes pdf files, extracts its metadata, keywords and summary, and adds the information in a MongoDB database.

* The task was completed by splitting it into subtasks like PDF downloading, PDF parsing to get the metadata and perform keyword extraction and extractive summarization. The information obtained was finally updated in MOngoDB.*
